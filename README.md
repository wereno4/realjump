# Jump King But It's Real Jump

Inspired by [pjs9073](https://www.twitch.tv/pjs9073)'s Youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZKS0vWEIwI). Shout out to his brother who did this great work.

This code is in developing, but if it is finished and if you want to use it, maybe you will need to install opencv, numpy, pyautogui, keyboards library.

if you use this code to make some content(live streaming, video, etc.), please mention pjs9073 and his brother who came up with this idea.
